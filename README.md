<h1>1.     System Description</h1>

Taylorâ€™s Professional Services is a technical and engineering staffing service.  When a TPS client company determines that it will need a temporary professional or scientific employee, it issues a staffing request against the contract it previously negotiated with TPS.

TPS wants to provide a web site so that their clients can complete a staffing request over the internet.  In addition, TPS wants to provide their clients with a list of potential candidates based on experience, education, salary, and location.  A client will be able to select up to three potential staff members along with the location of work, type of work, and salary and submit the request to the contract manager. Once a client issues a staffing request, the system shall provide an automated response stating that the contract manager will validate their request within 24 hours of receipt.

Once a staffing request has been issued, the client will be able to log into the site and search for a staff request by number.  The staff request query will result in a page that contains all staff request information along with a field that states whether the staff request is valid, invalid, unable to fill, or filled.

In addition, TPS staff members should be able update their resumes and picture through the web site.

The two areas of the website will be partitioned so that only clients with valid contract numbers and password are able to enter the client area and staff members with only valid employee numbers and password will be able to enter the staff area.  Only the contract manager has full access to both locations.
